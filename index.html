    <h1>Helloooooo World! <em>*leer*Okay lets try changing this line. Ahh, there 's the blue gutter line</em></h1>
    <p>Oh yeah, I'm lookin' at you, you sexay thang.</p>
    <p>this line has been added, but it's not putting in the green line, just the same blue one. Oops, nope, there it
        goes.Apparently if it's too close to another changed line it just continues the blue line</p>
    <p>And now I'm in the new <em>test</em> branch. Ooooohhhh.</p>
